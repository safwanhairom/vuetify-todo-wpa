There are many great front end framework. I decided to use vuetify as my side project in order for learning purpose.
There are a few things i like about vuetify.

Here's why:
* Simplicity
* Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) Architecture
* Easy to Learn :smile:
* Community and Support

Of course, no one framework will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
